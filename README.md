# STEVE_NO2
Photochemical model for investigating the NO2 hypothesis for STEVE (Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement) continuum emission. Can the NO + O --> NO2 + hv reaction explain why STEVE is so bright? And why it occurs under the conditions it does?  This code runs the model and creates the plot in Harding et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087102
